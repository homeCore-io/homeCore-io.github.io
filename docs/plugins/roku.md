# Roku players and TVs (`hc-roku`)

Brings Roku streaming players and Roku TVs into homeCore over the
[External Control Protocol](https://developer.roku.com/dev/docs/external-control-api)
(ECP) — a plain-HTTP API every Roku serves on port 8060.

Each device registers as one `media_player`. Devices on the local subnet
are found automatically over SSDP; nothing needs configuring beyond the
broker connection.

## Before you start

On each Roku, set:

> Settings → System → Advanced system settings → Control by mobile apps
> → **Network access** = `Default` or `Permissive`

With this **Disabled**, ECP still answers status queries but rejects every
keypress with HTTP 403 — the device appears in homeCore, reports what it is
playing, and ignores all control. The plugin surfaces that 403 with the
setting to change, but it is easier to set it first.

## Published state

| Attribute | Notes |
|---|---|
| `state` | `playing` \| `paused` \| `stopped` \| `idle` \| `buffering` \| `unavailable` |
| `on`, `power_mode` | `power_mode` is Roku's own: `PowerOn`, `Ready`, `DisplayOff`, `Headless`, `PowerOff` |
| `source`, `app_id`, `app_name`, `app_type`, `app_version` | Active channel or TV input; `source` is `"Home"` on the home screen |
| `is_tv_input` | True when the active "app" is an HDMI/AV/tuner input |
| `media_title`, `media_description` | Live-TV programme info — Roku reports no title for streaming apps |
| `media_position`, `media_duration` | Seconds, with `_ms` variants alongside |
| `media_is_live`, `media_error`, `media_format` | From `query/media-player` |
| `screensaver_active`, `screensaver_name` | |
| `tv_channel`, `tv_channel_name`, `tv_channel_info` | Roku TV tuned to the antenna input |
| `available_sources`, `available_apps`, `available_inputs`, `available_tv_channels` | Refreshed hourly |
| `model_name`, `serial_number`, `software_version`, `is_tv`, `is_stick`, `supports_*` | Plus the full firmware dump under `device_info` |

There is **no `volume` attribute**. ECP exposes VolumeUp/Down/Mute as key
presses and reports no level back, so there is nothing to publish. Same
reason there is no seek: `media_position` is read-only.

## Commands

Send to `homecore/devices/{id}/cmd`, or `PATCH /api/v1/devices/{id}/state`.
Both an `action` form and an attribute form work.

**Attributes** — `on` (bool), `source` (channel/input name or id), `state`
(`playing` / `paused` / `stopped`), `tv_channel`, `mute`, `key`, `text`.

| Group | Actions |
|---|---|
| Power | `power_on`, `power_off`, `power_toggle` |
| Transport | `play`, `pause`, `play_pause`, `stop`, `next`, `previous`, `instant_replay` |
| Navigation | `home`, `back`, `select`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `info`, `enter`, `backspace`, `find_remote` |
| Volume | `volume_up`, `volume_down`, `mute` — all accept `count` |
| Live TV | `channel_up`, `channel_down`, `tune` (`channel: "14.3"`) |
| Apps | `launch_app` (`app`, `content_id`, `media_type`, `params`), `select_source`, `install_app`, `exit_app`, `app_state` |
| Raw input | `key` (`key`, `count`, `hold_ms`), `key_hold`, `key_down`, `key_up`, `text` (`text`, `submit`), `send_input`, `search` |

`play` and `pause` are **idempotent**. Roku's `Play` is a single toggling
key, so both check the last polled state and do nothing when the device is
already where you asked for — which is what makes them safe in a rule.
`play_pause` toggles unconditionally.

```bash
# Turn on and open Netflix
curl -X PATCH localhost:8080/api/v1/devices/roku_living_room/state \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"on": true, "source": "Netflix"}'

# Deep-link to a title
curl -X PATCH localhost:8080/api/v1/devices/roku_living_room/state \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"action":"launch_app","app":"Netflix","content_id":"80100172","media_type":"movie"}'

# Type into a search box and submit
curl -X PATCH localhost:8080/api/v1/devices/roku_living_room/state \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"action":"text","text":"the expanse","submit":true}'

# Tune a Roku TV to 14.3
curl -X PATCH localhost:8080/api/v1/devices/roku_tv/state \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"action":"tune","channel":"14.3"}'
```

## Plugin actions

| Action | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `discover_devices` | Streaming SSDP sweep; registers what it finds |
| `list_devices` | What the plugin manages, with address, serial, and reachability |
| `refresh_catalog` | Re-read installed channels, inputs, and the TV lineup now |
| `device_info` | Raw `query/device-info` per device — the first diagnostic to reach for |
| `send_command` | Run one device command and get a real success/failure back |
| `app_icon` | Channel icon as a data URI |
| `forget_stale_devices` | Unregister discovered devices that no longer answer (admin) |

## Setup

Install it from the registry — Plugins → Add in the web UI — and set the
broker connection. Rokus on the subnet register themselves within a few
seconds; run `discover_devices` to sweep on demand.

`[[devices]]` in the plugin's config is optional. Use it to pin a device
id, to reach a Roku across a VLAN, or when running with
`discovery_enabled = false`.

## Notes on the protocol

- **Discovery is link-local.** SSDP multicast does not cross VLANs, and
  does not cross a Docker bridge network. Use `manual_hosts` — or
  [host networking](../getting-started/docker.md) — for anything the
  multicast cannot reach. ECP itself is ordinary unicast HTTP and works
  regardless.
- **Identity survives DHCP.** Discovered devices are keyed by serial
  number and stored in the plugin's durable state, so a Roku that changes
  address keeps its homeCore id, name, room, and rules.
- **Powering on a TV that is fully off** needs Wake-on-LAN — nothing is
  listening for `PowerOn`. The plugin caches the MAC while the device is
  reachable and sends a magic packet when it is not.
- **The search endpoint was sunset in Roku OS 12.0** and is a no-op on
  current firmware. `exit_app` and `app_state` are developer-mode only.
