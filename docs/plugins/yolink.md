# YoLink (`hc-yolink`)

The hc-yolink plugin bridges the YoLink cloud MQTT service to HomeCore. YoLink devices (door sensors, motion sensors, temperature sensors, outlets, etc.) are registered as HomeCore devices.

## Prerequisites

- A YoLink account and hub
- Your YoLink MQTT credentials (UAID and secret key — available in the YoLink app under Account settings)

## Configuration

```toml
[homecore]
broker_host = "127.0.0.1"
broker_port = 1883
plugin_id   = "plugin.yolink"
password    = ""

[yolink]
# MQTT credentials from YoLink app
uaid      = "your-uaid"
secret    = "your-secret-key"
mqtt_host = "mqtt.yosmart.com"
mqtt_port = 8003
```

## Running

```bash
cd /path/to/hc-yolink
./hc-yolink config/config.toml
```

The plugin connects to the YoLink cloud MQTT broker, discovers all devices associated with your account, and registers them with HomeCore.

## Device IDs

YoLink device IDs follow the pattern `yolink_{device_id}` where `device_id` is the YoLink-assigned device identifier (16 hex characters):

```
yolink_d88b4c01000e82eb    ← door sensor
yolink_a3f291b200045c12    ← temperature sensor
yolink_cc8102a3000b7e45    ← smart outlet
```

## Supported device types

| YoLink device | `device_type` | Key attributes |
|---|---|---|
| Door/window sensor | `door_sensor` | `open` (bool), `battery` (int) |
| Motion sensor | `motion_sensor` | `motion` (bool), `battery` (int) |
| Temperature/humidity | `sensor` | `temperature` (float), `humidity` (float), `battery` (int) |
| Smart outlet | `switch` | `on` (bool), `power_w` (float) |
| Leak sensor | `sensor` | `wet` (bool), `battery` (int) |
| Vibration sensor | `sensor` | `vibration` (bool), `battery` (int) |

## Common rule patterns

### Door open alert

```toml
name = "Front door — alert"
enabled = true

[trigger]
type      = "device_state_changed"
device_id = "yolink_d88b4c01000e82eb"
attribute = "open"
to        = true

[[actions]]
type    = "notify"
channel = "telegram"
message = "Front door opened"
```

### Low battery alert

```toml
name = "YoLink — low battery"
enabled = true
cooldown_secs = 86400   # alert once per day max

[trigger]
type      = "device_state_changed"
device_id = "yolink_d88b4c01000e82eb"
attribute = "battery"

[[conditions]]
type      = "device_state"
device_id = "yolink_d88b4c01000e82eb"
attribute = "battery"
op        = "Lt"
value     = 20

[[actions]]
type    = "notify"
channel = "telegram"
message = "YoLink front door sensor battery is low: {{device.battery}}%"
```

## Device name sync

When a device is renamed in the YoLink app, the new name is synced to HomeCore at the next state update from that device. The update only takes effect after a confirmed state message — not immediately on registration. Restarting hc-yolink forces a full re-registration that syncs all names immediately.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Plugin fails to connect | Check UAID and secret in config; verify YoLink account credentials |
| Devices not appearing | Check that devices are online in the YoLink app and have been used recently |
| State not updating | YoLink cloud MQTT may have a delay; check YoLink app for offline sensors |
| `online`/`offline` flapping | Check device battery level and WiFi/LoRa range |

## Log rotation

hc-yolink writes logs to `logs/hc-yolink.log`. Rotation and compression are configured in `config/config.toml`:

```toml
[logging]
level       = "info"   # stderr log level; RUST_LOG overrides this
rotation    = "daily"  # daily | hourly | weekly | never
max_size_mb = 100      # rotate when file exceeds this MB (0 = time-only)
compress    = true     # gzip rotated files in a background thread
```

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `logs/hc-yolink.log` | Active log (always uncompressed) |
| `logs/hc-yolink.2026-03-27.log.gz` | Rotated daily file (compressed) |
| `logs/hc-yolink.2026-03-27.1.log.gz` | Second rotation in same period (size limit hit) |
